# Generate configuration for Apache ZooKeeper ensemble

**Author: [Patrick Hunt](https://people.apache.org/~phunt/)** (follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/phunt))

## Summary

[This project](https://github.com/phunt/zkconf) will generate all of the configuration needed to run a [ZooKeeper ensemble](https://zookeeper.apache.org) I mainly use this tool for localhost based testing, but it can generate configurations for any list of servers (see the --server option).

### What is Apache ZooKeeper

From the [official site](https://zookeeper.apache.org) "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3 is supported. (see "python2" git repo branch if you need python2 support)
- Cheetah version 3 - see below

### Requirements - Cheetah Python 3

- Cheetah has been forked to support python 3 - "pip install cheetah3"

before using the first time (or on update) run the following command. You may or may not need to use the shbang option depending upon how your python environment is setup:

```bash
cheetah-compile --shbang='#!/usr/bin/env python3' *.tmpl
```

</pre>

Where zookeeper_dir is the location of your ZooKeeper trunk (zkconf copies the jars/confs from this directory into the output_dir to make your life easier). And output_dir is the directory to which we will output the generated files (assumption is that this is a non-existent directory - ie zkconf will create it)

example of typical use; 9 server quorum:

```bash
zkconf.py --count 9 ~/zookeeper_trunk test9servers
```

```bash
zkconf.py --servers "host1.com,host2.com,168.1.1.1" ~/zookeeper_trunk test3servers
```

example of using weights/groups (only for flex quorum, not typical); 9 servers with 3 groups

```bash
zkconf.py -c 9 --weights="1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0" --groups="1:2:3:4:5,6:7,8:9" ~/dev/workspace/gitzk testflexquroum
```

Running localhost (default) starts client:quorum:election ports as 2181:3181:4181 respectively. Running non-localhost (--servers) starts client:quorum:elections ports for all hosts as 2181:3181:4181.

- cli.sh "server:port,server:port,..." - open a client to the server list
- status.sh - status of each of the servers (prints leader | follower if active)
- start.sh - start the ensemble (logs are output to the respective server subdir, localhost only)
- stop.sh - stop the ensemble (localhost only)

## Running remotely

If servers are listed in the command line, zkconf will generate shell scripts which help you to upload ZooKeeper files and start/stop ensemble remotely. For instance, you want to start a "real" ensemble running on separate machines / VMs.

```bash
zkconf.py --servers "host1.com,host2.com,168.1.1.1" --username foobar ~/zookeeper_trunk test3servers
```

Argument username is optional, root will be used by default if it's missing. The following scripts will be available:

- copycat.sh - transfer the files to remote servers
- startcat.sh - start ensemble remotely
- stopcat.sh - stop ensemble remotely

Status can be checked with the same script that was mentioned in the previous section.

## SSL

SSL support can be enabled by adding --ssl argument to the command line. This will turn on both client-server and server-server SSL support and disable non-SSL connections.

You might also want to take a look at zoocfg.tmpl template file before the Cheetah compile and make sure keystore/truststore location is correct and password is defined.

Generate self-signed certificate

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -alias $(hostname -f) -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -dname "cn=$(hostname -f)" -keypass password -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password
```

Export certificate from keystore

```bash
keytool -exportcert -alias $(hostname -f) -keystore keystore.jks -file $(hostname -f).cer -rfc
```

Import certiciate to truststore

```bash
keytool -importcert -file Andors-MacBook-Pro.local.cer -keystore truststore.jks
```

## Troubleshooting

It's possible to overload a machine when running lots of ZK ensemble members - if you run into an error such as "NoRouteToHostException: No valid address" you may need to update the ICMP rate limit which isset to 250 by default. You can turn this off using the following command:

```bash
sudo sysctl -wnet.inet.icmp.icmplim=0
```
